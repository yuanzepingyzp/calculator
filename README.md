# calculator
<h6>the source code is on the gh-page brunch</h6>
<p>this project is powered by angularjs the mvvm javascript framework,the logic of this project are really simple.It is about three keywords 'binding','string','eval'.More concretely,the input element is binded to a model,and this 'model' is a string can be operated by the 'eval()' function,for example eval('1+2') equal to 3.So every button of the calculator is binded to a function that was used to change the model,for example if the '1' button was clicked it will trigger a function this function should be scope.model=scope.model+'1';that's it simple enough.
